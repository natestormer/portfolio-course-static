## Letâ€™s Build a Portfolio Site Course

### Overview and Goal

The computer screen is a fantastic canvas with close to limitless possibilities. It can present beautiful designs that shift, animate, and morph to our desires and choices. However, to truly unlock the power of experience design, we must venture into the realm of logic and code.

As a designer, this can seem a daunting task well outside our discipline and comfort zone. I had the same fears and trepidations when first venturing into the world of development. I began to read programming books, take online courses, and bookmark all development blogs I stumbled across. Mistakingly, I had assumed all of the syntax, design patterns, language features, protocols, and techniques needed to be stamped into my brain before I could build anything. After weeks of grappling with all the knowledge and foreign concepts, I realized I could not translate a single design to an interface. Had I wasted all of this time to no avail? Is it mutually exclusive to be a designer and developer? Should I give up?

Disconcerted and defeated, I thought back to the time I first picked up a pencil and decided to draw. Was I instantly able to strike a dynamic and exciting pose? No. Was I able to recreate a proportional human face on paper that didn't look like a weird alien? No. Was I able to create values and shifts in tone that resembled a shadow in real life? No. All of that came with practice and the act of putting pencil to paper. Perhaps I would pick up a book on gesture drawing or rendering and learn techniques used by others, but I would always pick up a pencil and paper and try to apply what I had learned. In my studio drawing classes, we would spend a small amount of time receiving instructions from our professor only to invest a vast amount of time practicing those instructions. Maybe learning to code requires a similar mindset? Learn a little to practice a lot.

With this mindset, let's learn how we can demystify development. Throughout this course, I want us to explore and learn core concepts of code and the web and use them to build a functioning site. We will start with the most basic approaches while gradually consenting to complexity as our knowledge and experience progresses.

### Course Milestones

We use this [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/noEnNgyrvsZg9Zeibo5rwD/Portfolio-Workshop?node-id=167%3A0) to plan our site.

1. Build a site as static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) and host on Netlify.
1. Convert the static assets to a Gatsby + React app so we can add fun interactions and dynamic data sourcing (this will exist in another repository).

### Concepts We Will Cover

1. Fundamentals of a web server and HTTP
1. Separation of concerns HTML, CSS, JS
1. Semantic markup with HTML
1. Styling with CSS
1. Interaction and functionality with JS

### Tools We Will Use

1. VS Code
1. Figma
1. Git
1. Google Chrome and Chrome Dev Tools

### Services We Will Use

1. GitHub
1. Netlify
1. Netlify Forms
