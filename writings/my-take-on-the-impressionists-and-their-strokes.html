          Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by
          relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition,
          emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities
          (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary
          subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human
          perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism
          originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent
          exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

          In the early 1860s, four young painters—Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste
          Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille—met while studying under
          the academic artist Charles Gleyre. They discovered that they shared
          an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than
          historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had
          become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into
          the countryside together to paint in the open air,<sup
            ><a href="#cite5">[5]</a></sup
          >
          but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into
          carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom.<sup
            ><a href="#cite6">[6]</a></sup
          >
          By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of
          the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the
          beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter
          manner of painting that extended further the Realism of Gustave
          Courbet and the Barbizon school. A favourite meeting place for the
          artists was the Café Guerbois on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the
          discussions were often led by Édouard Manet, whom the younger artists
          greatly admired. They were soon joined by Camille Pissarro, Paul
          Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin.<sup><a href="#cite7">[7]</a></sup>
